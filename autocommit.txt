void setAutoCommit(boolean autoCommit) throws SQLException

Sets this connection's auto-commit mode to the given state. If a connection is in auto-commit mode, then all its 
SQL statements will be executed and committed as individual transactions. Otherwise, its SQL statements are grouped 
into transactions that are terminated by a call to either the method commit or the method rollback. 

By default, new connections are in auto-commit mode.

The commit occurs when the statement completes. The time when the statement completes depends on the type of SQL Statement:

- For DML statements, such as Insert, Update or Delete, and DDL statements, the statement is complete as soon as it has finished executing.
- For Select statements, the statement is complete when the associated result set is closed.
- For CallableStatement objects or for statements that return multiple results, the statement is complete when all of the 
  associated result sets have been closed, and all update counts and output parameters have been retrieved.

NOTE: If this method is called during a transaction and the auto-commit mode is changed, the transaction is committed. 
      If setAutoCommit is called and the auto-commit mode is not changed, the call is a no-op.

Parameters:
autoCommit - true to enable auto-commit mode; false to disable it
Throws:
SQLException - if a database access error occurs, setAutoCommit(true) is called while participating in a distributed transaction, or this method is called on a closed connection
